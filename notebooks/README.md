# Task 1: Exploration of Customer Purchasing Behavior

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in every meaningful machine learning project. It helps uncover the nature of the data, informs the modeling approach, and reveals potential insights about the problem domain. This task focuses on exploring customer purchasing behavior in Rossmann Pharmaceuticals' stores.

## Objective
The goal of this task is to:
- Analyze customer behavior in various stores.
- Understand the impact of promotions and the opening of new stores on purchasing patterns.
- Prepare the data for further analysis and modeling by addressing missing values and outliers.
- Communicate findings effectively using visualizations.

## Data Cleaning Process
To ensure robust and unbiased analysis, the data cleaning process will involve:

1. **Pipeline for Outlier Detection and Handling**:
   - Identify outliers in key numerical features.
   - Apply appropriate techniques such as capping, removal, or transformation to mitigate their impact.

2. **Handling Missing Data**:
   - Detect missing values across all features.
   - Use techniques such as imputation (mean, median, mode, or advanced methods) or deletion, depending on the context and feature importance.
