# Rossmann Pharmaceuticals: Sales Forecasting

This project involves building and deploying an end-to-end machine learning solution to forecast sales across Rossmann Pharmaceuticals' stores for a six-week period. The model incorporates various factors such as promotions, competition, holidays, seasonality, and locality to generate accurate predictions. These forecasts will support the finance team in their decision-making processes.

## Objective
The primary objective is to develop a reliable sales forecasting tool that analysts in the finance team can use to:
- Anticipate sales trends.
- Optimize inventory management.
- Plan promotions and resource allocation effectively.

## Data Inputs
The following features are considered for the sales forecasting model:
- **Promotions**: Ongoing and upcoming promotions in stores.
- **Competition**: Details of nearby competitors and their distance.
- **School and State Holidays**: Impact of holidays on customer traffic.
- **Seasonality**: Seasonal sales trends based on historical data.
- **Locality**: Store-specific information such as location, demographics, and population density.

## Workflow
1. **Data Collection and Cleaning**: Aggregating historical sales data and cleaning it for analysis.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating additional features to capture trends and patterns.
3. **Model Selection and Training**: Building and evaluating machine learning models to ensure accurate predictions.
4. **Deployment**: Deploying the model as a service for the finance team.
5. **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Continuous monitoring and updating of the model for accuracy improvements.
